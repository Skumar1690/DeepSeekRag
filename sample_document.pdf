RAG Project Test Document
Created for DeepSeek API Integration

This document is a sample for testing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The system processes PDF files, extracts text, and uses the DeepSeek API to answer questions based on the content.

Key Points:
1. RAG combines text retrieval with AI generation for accurate answers.
2. The DeepSeek API powers the generation step, using a transformer-based model.
3. ChromaDB is used to store text embeddings for efficient retrieval.
4. The system is designed to handle questions about the document's content.

Applications:
- Question-answering systems for educational materials.
- Automated summarization of reports.
- Knowledge extraction from technical documents.
